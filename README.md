# Bookmarked

## Overview

I don't know about you, but I've bookmarked some pretty cool (and strange) things in my day. My bookmarks bar is an amalgamation of learning resources, articles I love and articles I have yet to read, and memes - oh the memes. I know that I've always been curious to see what other people keep in their Bookmarks bar so I'm creating a web application that lets you share and snoop! Once users register their account, they'll have the option to either drag and drop folders directly from their bookmarks bar into the application or manually create single Bookmarks.
